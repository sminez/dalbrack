## Disposition

Each PC has a disposition towards the faerie world and its impact on the human one:

  1. Indifferent      - human, faerie, sentient plan? Who cares.
  2. Better than here - this world sucks, maybe theirs is better
  3. Reverant         - we must worship the old ways and traditions
  4. Inquisitive      - the faerie world is something to learn about and from
  5. Righteous        - the faerie world is heretical and daemonic, it must be destroyed
  6. Opportunistic    - the faerie world is something that we can exploit for our benefit


These roughly form a matrix:

.                     bigger picture    personal gain
no opinion on faerie        1                2
respectful of faerie        3                4
      against faerie        5                6


Disposition should affect things like:
  - starting knowledge of the faearie world
  - what notes they make about what they encounter
  - relationships in town
  - relationships in the faerie world
