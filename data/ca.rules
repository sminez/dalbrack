# CA rules here are given in by their rulestring paired with a prefix of the
# % of initial floor tiles and the number of iterations to run.
#   - See https://catagolue.hatsya.com/rules/lifelike for a large list of rules
#   - See https://conwaylife.com/wiki/List_of_Life-like_rules for a shorter list
#     that also contains some descriptions of their properties and sometimes a
#     wiki page with more details.

# The parameters in this file for %floor and iterations are ones that I have found
# to produce interesting results. There is definitely a lot more to play with here
# though so variations should be tested as well.

55 5  | b45678s2345     # walled cities - produces lots of enclosed regions
69 9  | b01245s01245    # 01245         - this one is pretty good: large open spaces + twisting fragments
57 5  | b05678s05678    # tends to give small islands and a lot of shrapnel + one or two large islands
