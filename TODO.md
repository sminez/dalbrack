# TODO

- assign weights to actions and may a weighted choice rather than just first returned
- FollowPath needs to be able to stop if the actor has encountered new information that
  should cause it to update its behaviour
  - A simple start would be to track the entities in FOV and then stop if something new
    enters range?
- more map generation algorithms
  - design/notes.md has links to some references
- UI
- player / creature stats
